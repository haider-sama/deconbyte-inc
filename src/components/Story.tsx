                                In 2023, DeconByte Inc. was born from a vision held by three determined 
                                individuals, including our CEO, Haider. Starting with a strong foundation 
                                in web development, Haider began his journey with a deep passion for 
                                crafting exceptional web applications. With each project, he learned 
                                valuable lessons and refined his skills, driven by a relentless pursuit of 
                                excellence.

                                Fintech, and restaurant management systems. The early days were marked by hard 
                                work and a commitment to innovation, laying the groundwork for future growth.
